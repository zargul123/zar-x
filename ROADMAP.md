# ZAR X — ROADMAP & HANDOFF
*The single document a new session (any model) reads to continue the work.
FOR PHASE 2 AND BEYOND: follow EXECUTION_PLAN.md — exact steps, gates, and
if/then orders for every phase. It outranks improvisation.*
State as of 2026-07-26 (PHASE 2 COMPLETE; PHASE 3 OPEN — Step 3.1 DONE, Gate
3.1 passed 45/45). Read with README.md (mission + THE PROMISE), SHIP_LAWS.md
(now SEVEN laws — Law 7, the Leak Law, added 2026-07-26),
EDGE_STACK_RESEARCH.md (why), PROGRESS_LOG.md (history).
**NEXT BUILD SESSION: read SESSION_ORDERS.md — it carries the current step's
exact orders (right now: Phase 3, Step 3.2, Funding rates).**

## What exists and works (all gated live, all pushed)
| Part | File | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Data (candles, 429-proof, paginated, hold-out capable) | data/market_data.py | ✅ |
| Indicators (Elite set + EMA 20/50/200, cores=0) | indicators/technical.py | ✅ |
| Risk — Discipline Engine (ATR SL/TP, stop-distance sizing, 25% cap) | risk/calculator.py | ✅ |
| Regime vane (per-TF dials: 4h=1.96 calibrated; fail-honest) | regime/vane.py | ✅ |
| Morning Brief (the user's daily tool) | cockpit/brief.py | ✅ |
| Journal snapshots (the black box, split by writer: laptop → snapshots_local.csv, cloud → snapshots_cloud.csv, legacy snapshots.csv frozen) | journal/snapshot.py | ✅ |
| Grader v2 (merges all notebooks, candle-identity de-dup, always-UP parrot baseline) | journal/grader.py | ✅ |
| Automation (Task Scheduler: brief 09:05 PKT; snapshots at every 4h close) | run_daily.bat / run_snapshot.bat | ✅ |
| Context Deck — instrument 1 of 5: Fear & Greed (alternative.me, free, keyless; injectable URL, fails to one offline line) | cockpit/fear_greed.py | ✅ |
| THE LAB, complete (Phase 2, Gates 2.1–2.5 all passed 2026-07-26): frozen checksummed vault · data validator at the only door · honest backtest engine (look-ahead impossible, costs always on, hold-out line train_end=2025-10-01) · walk-forward + Monte Carlo (seed 20260726) + regime breakdown · exit gate that caught a 1,687-parameter con artist · leak_check (Law 7's aid) | lab/ | ✅ |

Run environment: `C:\Users\hp\miniconda3\envs\tfdml\python.exe` with `PYTHONUTF8=1`.

## Build queue (order now governed by EXECUTION_PLAN.md Phases 3–8; the list
## below is kept for history — EXECUTION_PLAN outranks it where they differ,
## e.g. the Context Deck (Phase 3) now comes BEFORE the trade logger (Phase 5))
1. **lab/** — ✅ DONE 2026-07-26 as EXECUTION_PLAN Phase 2 (five steps, five
   gates, all passed; see the Gate 2.1–2.5 entries in PROGRESS_LOG.md). The
   exit exam proved the pipeline rejects an overfit con artist end to end, and
   its honest limit — numbers cannot catch a leak — became Law 7.
2. **journal/ part 2** — trade logger (user records real/paper trades) + **the grader**
   (scores past snapshots against what prices did next; also monthly review of user's
   logged trades). Gate: grader correctly scores ≥2 weeks of accumulated snapshots.
3. **Context Deck** (cockpit) — 🔨 IN PROGRESS (EXECUTION_PLAN Phase 3, 1 of 5 done):
   ✅ Fear & Greed (alternative.me, free) 2026-07-26 · ⏭️ funding rates display
   (Binance public API) is the CURRENT step 3.2 · then news headlines (CryptoPanic
   free tier), event calendar, whale watch. Information ONLY, never signals. This closes the user's known blind spot: the system
   is math-only today; news/whales knowledge comes from the pilot until this ships.
4. **Layer 7 — Carry Monitor** (Kimi's structural edge): delta-neutral funding carry
   monitor with annualized-rate readout + risk caveats (exchange counterparty, funding
   flips). Instrument, not prediction — no gauntlet needed.
5. **THE GAUNTLET (sealed at 3 slots — THE PROMISE, see README):**
   Slot 1 Turtle/Donchian (daily/weekly, regime-filtered) · Slot 2 funding-rate extreme
   fade · Slot 3 on-chain cycle thermometer. Gates BEFORE each test (default: OOS PF ≥
   1.15, ≥30 trades, no lucky-month carry; Kimi adviser reviews). All fail → signals
   chapter closes permanently; cockpit stays information-only.
6. **Only with gauntlet survivors:** 8-week live proving, zero money, journal judging
   system AND pilot.

## MEASURED data-source facts (probed 2026-07-26 — never plan on a guess again)

Which sources serve deep history on demand decides what must be RECORDED and
what merely has to be READ. Every line below was measured, not assumed:

| Source | Depth actually served, free | Must we record it? |
|---|---|---|
| alternative.me Fear & Greed | FULL history (`limit=0`, back to 2018) | **No** |
| Binance funding rates `/fapi/v1/fundingRate` | **To contract inception** — BTC 2019-09-10, ETH 2019-11-27, SOL 2020-09-13; paginate `startTime` + `limit=1000` | **No** |
| Binance open interest `/futures/data/openInterestHist` | **30 DAYS ONLY** — 180 rows at 4h; older `startTime` is refused outright (code -1130) | **YES — the only one** |
| TwelveData candles (our vault) | ~3y 1d / 4h from 2024-01-01 (glitch zone excluded) | Already frozen in lab/vault/ |

**THE CORRECTION THAT MATTERS (2026-07-26):** earlier planning documents stated
that funding history is NOT served deep and that funding recording must begin
the day Step 3.2 ships, or Phase 6's Slot 2 could never be tested. **That was
wrong** — it was written from assumption and repeated into the Step 3.1 log,
marker and commit before anyone tested it. Binance serves ~7 years of settled
funding on demand. Slot 2 can be tested whenever we choose.

**The urgency was real but attached to the wrong instrument: it belongs to OPEN
INTEREST**, which Phase 3.5's Whale Watch needs and which vanishes after 30
days. And because every read can reach back 30 days, an OI recorder that runs
even monthly loses nothing — so the laptop is a sufficient recorder and there
is no emergency, only a deadline measured in weeks.

Also measured the same day: **OKX does not resolve from the Commander's
connection at all** (DNS failure); Binance and Bybit both answer normally.

## Standing answers to the Commander's questions (so they're never re-litigated)
- **"How does it know what will happen?"** It doesn't. It's a weather station + cockpit:
  describes what IS (trend/momentum/volatility/regime) and sizes risk IF the pilot acts.
- **"News/wars/whales?"** Today: pilot's job (human-in-the-loop is the design). The vane
  sees news *footprints* (chaos in price) but not causes. Context Deck (queue #3) adds
  headlines/sentiment as information. Never as signals without the gauntlet.
- **"Can the AI analyze reports to improve the system?"** Yes, in-session: the Commander
  opens a session and says "review the journal" → read snapshots.csv + daily_runs.log,
  report findings, propose improvements (Laws apply). The grader (queue #2) automates
  the scoring half.
- **"Is the code working?"** Every part has a smoke test (its gate) run against the live
  market before commit; failures self-report as "instrument offline"; git reverts anything.

## The Commander's daily ritual (Pakistan time)
Automatic if laptop is awake. Manual any time:
```
cd "C:\Users\hp\Downloads\zargul trader\zar-x"
set PYTHONUTF8=1
C:\Users\hp\miniconda3\envs\tfdml\python.exe cockpit\brief.py
C:\Users\hp\miniconda3\envs\tfdml\python.exe journal\snapshot.py
```

## History and provenance
Born from Zargul Trader 2.0 (github.com/zargul123/zargul-trader-2.0 — the museum):
a year of LSTM prediction work, honestly concluded 2026-07-19 with a complete negative
verdict (tag `prediction-chapter-closed`; full story in its PROGRESS_LOG.md). Zar X
keeps the proven organs and the honesty discipline; it does not predict.
