# ZAR X — Progress Log

Every build step, every test, every result — wins and losses alike.

---

## 2026-07-19 — THE KEEL IS LAID

Zar X founded. Name chosen by the Commander. Repository initialized, seven compartments
created (`data/ indicators/ regime/ signals/ risk/ lab/ cockpit/`), founding documents
written: README.md (mission + THE PROMISE) and EDGE_STACK_RESEARCH.md (full design
research from the final Fable session).

**Inheritance from Zargul Trader 2.0** (museum repo, tag `prediction-chapter-closed`):
- The verdict that founded this ship: LSTM price prediction has no extractable edge
  (BTC 1h -3.17, BTC 4h -2.25, ETH 4h -0.72, SOL 4h -0.66 — all full-year hidden exams)
- The honest-lab methodology: chronological validation, hold-out cutoffs, per-trade
  CSV X-rays, regime recalibration by calibration-period percentiles
- Proven organs to port in Stage 1: data engine (paginated, 429-proof), indicators,
  regime filter, risk engine, backtest lab, journal

**Next:** Stage 1 Phase 0 — port `data/` module + smoke test. Deliverable gate:
one command prints live BTC/ETH/SOL candles.

## 2026-07-19 — GitHub home + Ship Laws

Repo connected and pushed: github.com/zargul123/zar-x (branch main). SHIP_LAWS.md added —
the Commander's six laws: everything recorded with results and reasons; code in isolated
parts; fail-safe parts with smoke tests; gates before tests; explain-then-commit; THE PROMISE.

## 2026-07-19 — Amendment 1: Layer 7 Carry Monitor, Build Order A

Kimi's structural-edge contribution adopted (funding carry monitor as instrument, not
prediction). Build order fixed: Hull → Carry Monitor → context instruments → gauntlet
slots last. Win%×payoff−costs reading law recorded. Phase 0 (data compartment port)
begins now. Gate: one command prints live BTC/ETH/SOL candles.

## 2026-07-19 — PHASE 0 COMPLETE: data compartment alive (GATE PASSED)

Ported from museum: TwelveData fetch (429-retry, 65s wait), pagination with 8s pacing,
Yahoo fallback, hold-out end_date cutoff — into `data/market_data.py` (clean candles ONLY;
indicators deliberately left for their own compartment per Law 2). `config.py` created as
single source of settings; `.env` key installed (gitignored). Fail-safe pattern in place:
"DATA INSTRUMENT OFFLINE" instead of crashes.

**Gate result:** `python data/smoke_test.py` → live candles for all three assets
(BTC $64,510.71 / ETH $1,869.61 / SOL $76.12 at 2026-07-19 12:00). PASSED.

**Next:** indicators/ compartment port + smoke test.

## 2026-07-19 — Part 2: indicators/ compartment (GATE PASSED)

Ported the proven Elite indicator set (rsi, macd, bbands, adx, mfi, atr + cores=0 memory
fix) from the museum, added ema_20/50/200 for Brief trend state, kept time features and
cleanup order. Fail-safe: returns candles untouched + "INDICATORS INSTRUMENT OFFLINE" on
error. CORE_COLUMNS contract published for consumers.
**Gate:** live BTC 300 candles → all 12 core columns, RSI 54.8 in range, ATR $497 positive,
trend check works (price ABOVE EMA-200). PASSED.
**Next:** risk/ compartment (SL/TP/size calculator) port.

## 2026-07-19 — Part 3: risk/ compartment — the Discipline Engine (GATE PASSED)

Ported from museum RiskManager: ATR calc + ATR-based SL/TP levels (faithful). Sizing
UPGRADED to the stop-distance formula (size = risk money / stop distance — the math that
makes ~40%-wrong survivable), with a 25% max-position cap. Deliberately NOT ported, with
reasons: trailing stop (2026 data showed it cut winners/kept losers), should_execute
(dead AI-prediction pipeline). RISK_CONFIG added to config.py (1% risk default).
**Gate:** live BTC long plan on $1000 → SL<entry<TP, R:R 1.33 as configured, cap engaged
correctly ($250 position, $2.49 risk). PASSED.
**Next:** regime/ compartment (vane with per-timeframe calibration).

## 2026-07-19 — Part 4: regime/ compartment — the weather vane (GATE PASSED)

Ported with three lessons applied: per-timeframe entropy dials (4h = calibrated 1.96;
1h = 1.5), fail-honest "Uncalibrated" for undialed timeframes, stateless per-reading
replay (fixes the museum's shared-EMA cross-asset contamination bug). HONEST STATUS in
docstring: context instrument, NOT proven alpha (failed fresh-year P&L rescue test).
**Gate:** live BTC 4h → "Ranging" (entropy 1.952 vs dial 1.96, ADX 23.3); 1d correctly
answers "Uncalibrated". PASSED.
**Next:** lab/ (honest backtester redesigned around rule-signals) OR cockpit Morning Brief.

## 2026-07-19 — Part 5: THE MORNING BRIEF IS ALIVE (Stage 1 core deliverable)

`python cockpit/brief.py` → full live briefing, 3/3 assets: price + 24h change, trend
state (EMA50/200), RSI momentum, ATR volatility, weather reading (calibrated vane), and
a disciplined example risk plan per asset. Assembled purely through compartment doorways;
offline instruments self-report without stopping the Brief.
**First-ever live Brief (2026-07-19 20:41):** BTC $64,580 UP-trend Ranging; ETH $1,874
UP-trend Chaotic; SOL $76.24 MIXED Chaotic. All instruments reporting.
**Stage 1 status:** data ✅ indicators ✅ risk ✅ regime ✅ Brief ✅ — remaining: lab/ port
(honest backtester redesigned around rule-signals) + journal, then Layer 7 Carry Monitor.

## 2026-07-19 — Part 6: journal/ snapshots — the black box (GATE PASSED)

`python journal/snapshot.py` appends one row per asset to journal/snapshots.csv:
UTC time, price, trend state, RSI, ATR(%), regime reading. Purpose: score the
instruments against reality later ("said UP on the 15th — what happened?"). First
entries recorded live (BTC UP/Ranging, ETH UP/Chaotic, SOL MIXED/Chaotic).
User's daily ritual (Pakistan time): run Brief + snapshot ~09:05 PKT (after the
09:00 candle close; timestamps inside are UTC = PKT-5).
**Next:** lab/ (honest backtester around rule-signals), then trade-logging half of the
journal, then Carry Monitor.

## 2026-07-19 — Part 7: Automation — Zar X runs itself (GATE PASSED)

Windows Task Scheduler registered: "ZarX Morning Brief" daily 09:05 PKT (full ritual:
Brief + snapshot -> journal/daily_runs.log) and "ZarX Evening Snapshot" daily 21:05 PKT
(extra evidence row). run_daily.bat / run_snapshot.bat added (ASCII/CRLF endings — cmd
chokes on LF-only bats, fixed and re-gated: zero errors). Limitation recorded: laptop
must be on and awake at run time; missed runs are skipped (manual run any time is valid).
Reading the log: use UTF-8 (e.g. `Get-Content journal\daily_runs.log -Encoding UTF8`).

## 2026-07-19 — Snapshots at every 4h close + ROADMAP.md handoff

Commander's request: snapshot cadence raised from 2x to 6x daily — Task Scheduler now
fires run_snapshot.bat at every 4h candle close (01:05/05:05/13:05/17:05/21:05 PKT,
morning 09:05 covered by the full ritual). API cost ~18/800 daily credits. ROADMAP.md
written: complete state, build queue (lab → grader → Context Deck → Carry Monitor →
sealed gauntlet), standing answers, daily ritual, provenance — the single handoff
document for any future session/model.

## 2026-07-19 — Automation incident & fix: the missing-quotes trap (RESOLVED, verified by fire)

The first scheduled run (21:05) failed with 0x80070002 "file not found": schtasks stored
the bat path WITHOUT quotes, so Windows read it only to the first space ("...\zargul").
Fix: all six tasks recreated via native PowerShell cmdlets (Register-ScheduledTask) with
Execute=cmd.exe, Arguments=/c "quoted path" — immune to spaces. Verified by test-firing
through the real scheduler: snapshot wrote 3 rows autonomously at 21:10 PKT
(BTC $64,522 UP/Ranging; ETH $1,869 UP/Chaotic; SOL $76.05 MIXED/Chaotic) — Zar X's
first fully autonomous action.

## 2026-07-19 — Part 8: the Trade Planner (GATE PASSED)

Commander's feedback: "trend UP alone is nothing — where is my stop loss?" → built
cockpit/plan.py: the pilot states asset/direction/capital (+optional risk% and entry),
Zar X answers the full disciplined plan from live data: SL, TP, exact size, money lost
if wrong, gained if right, weather context. Clarified the two outputs: snapshots = the
science notebook (for the future grader), the Brief + Planner = the pilot's tools.
**Gate:** live plan for long BTC on $500 → SL/TP correct sides, 25% cap engaged,
loss-if-wrong $1.41 (0.28% of capital). PASSED.

## 2026-07-19 — Part 9: THE GRADER — the system now checks itself (GATE PASSED)

ROADMAP queue item #2 (first half) built on Commander's request: run the existing system
7 days and have it verify its own basic readings automatically. journal/grader.py scores
every snapshot trend claim (UP/DOWN) against what price actually did 6 candles (24h)
later; MIXED rows carry no claim; young rows honestly reported as "not yet gradable".
Wired into the 09:05 daily ritual — every morning: Brief → snapshot → self-exam, all in
daily_runs.log. **Gate:** first run correctly reports 12 claims / 0 gradable / "come back
after 24h" — fail-honest behavior verified. First real grades appear 2026-07-20+.
**7-day observation plan:** system self-grades daily; Commander may ask "zar x, review
the journal" any day; full week-1 review ~2026-07-26. Build queue continues unchanged
(lab next) in parallel sessions.
