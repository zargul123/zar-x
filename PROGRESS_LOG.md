# ZAR X — Progress Log

Every build step, every test, every result — wins and losses alike.

---

## 2026-07-19 — THE KEEL IS LAID

Zar X founded. Name chosen by the Commander. Repository initialized, seven compartments
created (`data/ indicators/ regime/ signals/ risk/ lab/ cockpit/`), founding documents
written: README.md (mission + THE PROMISE) and EDGE_STACK_RESEARCH.md (full design
research from the final Fable session).

**Inheritance from Zargul Trader 2.0** (museum repo, tag `prediction-chapter-closed`):
- The verdict that founded this ship: LSTM price prediction has no extractable edge
  (BTC 1h -3.17, BTC 4h -2.25, ETH 4h -0.72, SOL 4h -0.66 — all full-year hidden exams)
- The honest-lab methodology: chronological validation, hold-out cutoffs, per-trade
  CSV X-rays, regime recalibration by calibration-period percentiles
- Proven organs to port in Stage 1: data engine (paginated, 429-proof), indicators,
  regime filter, risk engine, backtest lab, journal

**Next:** Stage 1 Phase 0 — port `data/` module + smoke test. Deliverable gate:
one command prints live BTC/ETH/SOL candles.

## 2026-07-19 — GitHub home + Ship Laws

Repo connected and pushed: github.com/zargul123/zar-x (branch main). SHIP_LAWS.md added —
the Commander's six laws: everything recorded with results and reasons; code in isolated
parts; fail-safe parts with smoke tests; gates before tests; explain-then-commit; THE PROMISE.

## 2026-07-19 — Amendment 1: Layer 7 Carry Monitor, Build Order A

Kimi's structural-edge contribution adopted (funding carry monitor as instrument, not
prediction). Build order fixed: Hull → Carry Monitor → context instruments → gauntlet
slots last. Win%×payoff−costs reading law recorded. Phase 0 (data compartment port)
begins now. Gate: one command prints live BTC/ETH/SOL candles.

## 2026-07-19 — PHASE 0 COMPLETE: data compartment alive (GATE PASSED)

Ported from museum: TwelveData fetch (429-retry, 65s wait), pagination with 8s pacing,
Yahoo fallback, hold-out end_date cutoff — into `data/market_data.py` (clean candles ONLY;
indicators deliberately left for their own compartment per Law 2). `config.py` created as
single source of settings; `.env` key installed (gitignored). Fail-safe pattern in place:
"DATA INSTRUMENT OFFLINE" instead of crashes.

**Gate result:** `python data/smoke_test.py` → live candles for all three assets
(BTC $64,510.71 / ETH $1,869.61 / SOL $76.12 at 2026-07-19 12:00). PASSED.

**Next:** indicators/ compartment port + smoke test.

## 2026-07-19 — Part 2: indicators/ compartment (GATE PASSED)

Ported the proven Elite indicator set (rsi, macd, bbands, adx, mfi, atr + cores=0 memory
fix) from the museum, added ema_20/50/200 for Brief trend state, kept time features and
cleanup order. Fail-safe: returns candles untouched + "INDICATORS INSTRUMENT OFFLINE" on
error. CORE_COLUMNS contract published for consumers.
**Gate:** live BTC 300 candles → all 12 core columns, RSI 54.8 in range, ATR $497 positive,
trend check works (price ABOVE EMA-200). PASSED.
**Next:** risk/ compartment (SL/TP/size calculator) port.

## 2026-07-19 — Part 3: risk/ compartment — the Discipline Engine (GATE PASSED)

Ported from museum RiskManager: ATR calc + ATR-based SL/TP levels (faithful). Sizing
UPGRADED to the stop-distance formula (size = risk money / stop distance — the math that
makes ~40%-wrong survivable), with a 25% max-position cap. Deliberately NOT ported, with
reasons: trailing stop (2026 data showed it cut winners/kept losers), should_execute
(dead AI-prediction pipeline). RISK_CONFIG added to config.py (1% risk default).
**Gate:** live BTC long plan on $1000 → SL<entry<TP, R:R 1.33 as configured, cap engaged
correctly ($250 position, $2.49 risk). PASSED.
**Next:** regime/ compartment (vane with per-timeframe calibration).

## 2026-07-19 — Part 4: regime/ compartment — the weather vane (GATE PASSED)

Ported with three lessons applied: per-timeframe entropy dials (4h = calibrated 1.96;
1h = 1.5), fail-honest "Uncalibrated" for undialed timeframes, stateless per-reading
replay (fixes the museum's shared-EMA cross-asset contamination bug). HONEST STATUS in
docstring: context instrument, NOT proven alpha (failed fresh-year P&L rescue test).
**Gate:** live BTC 4h → "Ranging" (entropy 1.952 vs dial 1.96, ADX 23.3); 1d correctly
answers "Uncalibrated". PASSED.
**Next:** lab/ (honest backtester redesigned around rule-signals) OR cockpit Morning Brief.

## 2026-07-19 — Part 5: THE MORNING BRIEF IS ALIVE (Stage 1 core deliverable)

`python cockpit/brief.py` → full live briefing, 3/3 assets: price + 24h change, trend
state (EMA50/200), RSI momentum, ATR volatility, weather reading (calibrated vane), and
a disciplined example risk plan per asset. Assembled purely through compartment doorways;
offline instruments self-report without stopping the Brief.
**First-ever live Brief (2026-07-19 20:41):** BTC $64,580 UP-trend Ranging; ETH $1,874
UP-trend Chaotic; SOL $76.24 MIXED Chaotic. All instruments reporting.
**Stage 1 status:** data ✅ indicators ✅ risk ✅ regime ✅ Brief ✅ — remaining: lab/ port
(honest backtester redesigned around rule-signals) + journal, then Layer 7 Carry Monitor.

## 2026-07-19 — Part 6: journal/ snapshots — the black box (GATE PASSED)

`python journal/snapshot.py` appends one row per asset to journal/snapshots.csv:
UTC time, price, trend state, RSI, ATR(%), regime reading. Purpose: score the
instruments against reality later ("said UP on the 15th — what happened?"). First
entries recorded live (BTC UP/Ranging, ETH UP/Chaotic, SOL MIXED/Chaotic).
User's daily ritual (Pakistan time): run Brief + snapshot ~09:05 PKT (after the
09:00 candle close; timestamps inside are UTC = PKT-5).
**Next:** lab/ (honest backtester around rule-signals), then trade-logging half of the
journal, then Carry Monitor.

## 2026-07-19 — Part 7: Automation — Zar X runs itself (GATE PASSED)

Windows Task Scheduler registered: "ZarX Morning Brief" daily 09:05 PKT (full ritual:
Brief + snapshot -> journal/daily_runs.log) and "ZarX Evening Snapshot" daily 21:05 PKT
(extra evidence row). run_daily.bat / run_snapshot.bat added (ASCII/CRLF endings — cmd
chokes on LF-only bats, fixed and re-gated: zero errors). Limitation recorded: laptop
must be on and awake at run time; missed runs are skipped (manual run any time is valid).
Reading the log: use UTF-8 (e.g. `Get-Content journal\daily_runs.log -Encoding UTF8`).

## 2026-07-19 — Snapshots at every 4h close + ROADMAP.md handoff

Commander's request: snapshot cadence raised from 2x to 6x daily — Task Scheduler now
fires run_snapshot.bat at every 4h candle close (01:05/05:05/13:05/17:05/21:05 PKT,
morning 09:05 covered by the full ritual). API cost ~18/800 daily credits. ROADMAP.md
written: complete state, build queue (lab → grader → Context Deck → Carry Monitor →
sealed gauntlet), standing answers, daily ritual, provenance — the single handoff
document for any future session/model.

## 2026-07-19 — Automation incident & fix: the missing-quotes trap (RESOLVED, verified by fire)

The first scheduled run (21:05) failed with 0x80070002 "file not found": schtasks stored
the bat path WITHOUT quotes, so Windows read it only to the first space ("...\zargul").
Fix: all six tasks recreated via native PowerShell cmdlets (Register-ScheduledTask) with
Execute=cmd.exe, Arguments=/c "quoted path" — immune to spaces. Verified by test-firing
through the real scheduler: snapshot wrote 3 rows autonomously at 21:10 PKT
(BTC $64,522 UP/Ranging; ETH $1,869 UP/Chaotic; SOL $76.05 MIXED/Chaotic) — Zar X's
first fully autonomous action.

## 2026-07-19 — Part 8: the Trade Planner (GATE PASSED)

Commander's feedback: "trend UP alone is nothing — where is my stop loss?" → built
cockpit/plan.py: the pilot states asset/direction/capital (+optional risk% and entry),
Zar X answers the full disciplined plan from live data: SL, TP, exact size, money lost
if wrong, gained if right, weather context. Clarified the two outputs: snapshots = the
science notebook (for the future grader), the Brief + Planner = the pilot's tools.
**Gate:** live plan for long BTC on $500 → SL/TP correct sides, 25% cap engaged,
loss-if-wrong $1.41 (0.28% of capital). PASSED.

## 2026-07-19 — Part 9: THE GRADER — the system now checks itself (GATE PASSED)

ROADMAP queue item #2 (first half) built on Commander's request: run the existing system
7 days and have it verify its own basic readings automatically. journal/grader.py scores
every snapshot trend claim (UP/DOWN) against what price actually did 6 candles (24h)
later; MIXED rows carry no claim; young rows honestly reported as "not yet gradable".
Wired into the 09:05 daily ritual — every morning: Brief → snapshot → self-exam, all in
daily_runs.log. **Gate:** first run correctly reports 12 claims / 0 gradable / "come back
after 24h" — fail-honest behavior verified. First real grades appear 2026-07-20+.
**7-day observation plan:** system self-grades daily; Commander may ask "zar x, review
the journal" any day; full week-1 review ~2026-07-26. Build queue continues unchanged
(lab next) in parallel sessions.

## 2026-07-19 — Automation upgrade: catch-up on wake

All six scheduled tasks set to StartWhenAvailable=true: if the laptop was closed/asleep
at an alarm time, the run fires automatically the moment the laptop wakes. Missed-hour
gaps remain harmless (grader scores whatever rows exist); no user action ever needed.

## 2026-07-20 — Part 10: the Cloud Watchman (deployed; gate pending secret)

Commander's request: snapshots must not depend on the laptop. GitHub Actions workflow
(.github/workflows/cloud_snapshot.yml) runs journal/snapshot.py on GitHub's own runner
at every 4h candle close (+5min, UTC cron) and commits new evidence rows back to the
repo — viewable from the phone anywhere via the GitHub app/site. requirements.txt added
for the cloud runner. Laptop ritual continues in parallel (double coverage; snapshot
timestamps make duplicates harmless).
**Gate (pending):** requires TWELVEDATA_API_KEY added by the Commander as a GitHub
Actions secret, then one manual workflow run must commit rows. Mobile OneDrive sync of
local reports also added to both runner bats (OneDrive\ZarX).

## 2026-07-20 — Incident: 01:05 snapshot skipped on battery (RESOLVED, verified)

The 01:05 PKT alarm did not fire despite the laptop being awake: Windows' default task
condition "do not start if on batteries" blocked it (laptop was unplugged). Fix:
DisallowStartIfOnBatteries and StopIfGoingOnBatteries set to false on all six tasks.
Missed shot fired as catch-up: success (result 0), rows landed 01:32 PKT (BTC $64,501
UP/Ranging; ETH $1,864 UP/Chaotic; SOL $75.96 MIXED/Chaotic). Also this session:
OneDrive mobile sync in both bats (OneDrive\ZarX) and the Cloud Watchman workflow
(pending user's GitHub secret + test run).

## 2026-07-20 — Cloud fix: vendored pandas_ta (zero-behavior-change option)

Cloud install failed because pandas-ta 0.3.14b0 is no longer served by PyPI (only 0.4.x
for Python >=3.12 exists). Chosen fix per Commander's "no morning surprises" rule:
vendor the EXACT library copy from the laptop's environment into vendor/pandas_ta
(0.86 MB, verified importable and version 0.3.14b0). Cloud workflow points PYTHONPATH at
vendor/; requirements slimmed. Local system untouched — indicators smoke gate re-run to
confirm: PASSED unchanged.

## 2026-07-20 — THE CLOUD WATCHMAN IS ALIVE (GATE PASSED)

After four honest onion layers (dirty-worktree ordering bug → PyPI no longer serves
pandas-ta 0.3.14b0 → vendored the laptop's exact library copy → patched its non-fatal
version lookup), the workflow ran green: commits 22f9b35/661a6cb authored by
zarx-cloud-watchman — GitHub's runner fetched live data and committed snapshot rows
autonomously (21:03/21:04 UTC). Zar X now has a redundant watch: laptop Task Scheduler
(6× daily + Brief + grader at 09:05) AND cloud every 4h independent of the laptop.
Evidence viewable from mobile: GitHub app → zar-x → journal/snapshots.csv. Known
cosmetic: Node.js deprecation annotation from GitHub's own actions — harmless, bump
checkout/setup-python versions in a calm session.

## 2026-07-20 — CHECK_STATUS.bat: one-click health check

Double-click shows: each laptop alarm's last run time with OK/never/error-code verdict,
the six newest black-box rows, and the reminder that the cloud guard is checked at the
repo's latest-commit line on GitHub. Window stays open until a key is pressed.

## 2026-07-20 — Cloud self-grading (Commander's design insight)

Commander spotted the gap: the cloud gathers the most complete diary (laptop sleeps;
cloud doesn't) but only the laptop graded. Cloud workflow now runs the Grader after
every snapshot and commits journal/cloud_grader_report.txt — an always-fresh graded
report card on the GitHub page, phone-readable. Laptop keeps grading its own diary at
09:05; Friday's review merges both. Two watchmen, both now self-examining.

## 2026-07-20 — MASTER PLAN v1 (brainstorm, agreed)

Visual artifact: claude.ai/code/artifact/edd0e5a4-34c4-493e-9f0f-4c87db3fc204
Synthesized from our roadmap + Kimi's detailed build manual + user's decisions.

**Nine phases:**
0. Foundation — DONE (the 7 live compartments + automation)
1. Honesty Check — NOW. + Data Validator; + old LSTM as a silent GRADED observer.
   (Regime v2 complexity — Hurst/fractal/voting — HELD until this evidence speaks.)
2. The Lab — sealed-vault data split, walk-forward, cost simulator, Monte Carlo,
   regime breakdown, lie detector. Gate: must catch a deliberately-bad dummy strategy.
3. Context Deck — fear&greed, funding, news headlines, event calendar, war-warnings.
   Shown as RAW pieces, NOT a fake-precise blended score. (Fixes the war blind spot.)
4. Carry Monitor — delta-neutral funding carry; structural income, no gauntlet needed.
5. Trade Logger & Mirror — one-command log, psychology tracking, monthly you-vs-system.
6. The Gauntlet — 3 sealed trials (Turtle / Funding-fade / Cycle), gates locked BEFORE
   testing (Kimi reviews). Only survivors give real buy/sell signals.
7. Proving Voyage — paper trading at the pilot's pace. USER DECISION: NO 4-trades/month
   cap (system informs, never blocks). 1% risk shown, not forced. Learning = human review
   only, never silent auto-tuning.
8. Permanent Loop — daily brief → decision → track → monthly review, for years.

**Three-Voice Courtroom:** ZarX instruments + old LSTM observer + gauntlet survivors,
all graded side by side, all silent until proven.

**Two ghosts CUT (with reasons):** (a) self-tuning autopilot — with ~50 paper trades/yr
you fit noise; the LSTM had 26,000 examples and still failed, so 50 fails faster; learning
stays human-in-the-loop at review time. (b) fake-precise blended "context score" mixing
unproven signals with invented weights — show raw pieces, let the pilot judge.

**Creed:** part-time, not competing with institutions; test everything; 2-year horizon;
50% of earnings → schools & hospitals.

## 2026-07-20 — ARCHITECT CRITIQUE (senior-architect review of the plan)

Cold review found the plan's philosophy/gates/sequencing sound, but the unglamorous
plumbing layer missing and one live security wound. Fix these BEFORE new features:

**Critical missing architecture:**
1. Two-writers problem: laptop + cloud both append the SAME snapshots.csv → recurring
   merge conflicts (hit again during THIS very session). Fix: split by writer
   (snapshots_cloud.csv / snapshots_local.csv), grader merges + de-duplicates.
2. Grader has NO duplicate protection → weekend manual test-fires (rows at 21:03 AND
   21:04, etc.) will pollute the week-1 report card. Fix: candle-identity rule
   (asset + timeframe + candle-open-time = ONE claim; extras discarded).
3. Phase-1 gate "beat a coin flip" is the WRONG baseline in an up-drifting market (a
   parrot that always says UP scores 55-60% with zero skill). Fix: grader also scores an
   "always-UP parrot" column; gate becomes "beats the parrot," not "beats the coin."
4. No frozen historical data store → the Sealed Vault is rhetorical (a live API returns
   today's data, not a fixed past). Fix: one-time checksummed backfill, stored, immutable.
5. LSTM observer (Voice 2) lives in a different repo/env — needs a bridge/adapter spec
   (predict-only harness writing into ZarX journal, keyed by candle identity).
6. No strategy versioning — a survivor's track record must not carry across a parameter
   change. Fix: stamp name + parameter-fingerprint + code-version on every signal.

**Security / scaling blind spots:**
- 🔴 API KEY LEAK: TwelveData error messages print the full request URL including
  apikey=...; daily_runs.log is git-TRACKED + pushed + OneDrive-synced, and the museum
  archive logs also contain it. Both repos private (moderate, not critical). Fix: redact
  key from error prints, untrack daily_runs.log, ROTATE the key (free, 2 min).
- GitHub Actions pinned by floating tag (@v4/@v5) with write access → pin to commit SHAs
  (soft, low urgency).
- Phase-2 compute (walk-forward × Monte Carlo 10k × strategies on laptop CPU) only viable
  with the frozen local store (#4) + vectorized simulation.
- Evidence file grows ~2,200 commits/yr; the writer-split (#1) also relieves this.

**Immediate order:** (1) security hygiene ~30min → (2) BEFORE Friday: grader dedup +
parrot baseline → (3) split black box by writer → (4) frozen backfill → (5) spec LSTM
adapter → (6) defer the rest. Plan's ordering otherwise correct.

## 2026-07-21 — Brainstorm clarifications recorded (the tool doorway + the five adopted tools)

**The Tool Doorway Rule (Commander asked when price-action math tools join):**
- As INFORMATION on the Brief (describe the chart, no buy/sell): may be added almost
  anytime, cheaply, a few per session — including any tool the Commander names.
- As SIGNALS (anything that says buy/sell): must pass through the Lab first and earn an
  honest stat card. No tool skips this — not RSI, not Fibonacci, not any guru's favorite.
- Therefore: small instrument additions can trickle in from next week; the BIG toolbox
  expansion happens right after the Lab exists, so every tool arrives with proof attached.

**Five adopted tools confirmed, each with its phase:**
1. Data Validator — Phase 1 (quality inspector at the data door)
2. Cost Simulator — Phase 2, in the Lab (our 1h-scar made into a tool: every simulated
   trade pays real fees/slippage)
3. Monte Carlo Stress Test — Phase 2, in the Lab (reshuffle trades 10,000× — luck detector)
4. Walk-Forward Testing — Phase 2, in the Lab (many windows; the +3.53/-0.87 lesson
   made into a machine)
5. Human-vs-Machine + Psychology — Phase 5, Trade Logger & Mirror (grades the pilot)

**Cloud status:** ran fully autonomous 24h+ (7+ consecutive watches, zero errors). First
real grades: 24/24 correct (100%) — read with the parrot warning: up-drifting market, no
baseline yet, duplicates not yet filtered. Exactly why the repairs come first.

**NEXT WORK SESSION (start here):** the three repairs, in order —
1. Security hygiene: redact API key from error prints, untrack daily_runs.log, rotate key
2. Grader honesty: candle-identity de-dup + always-UP parrot baseline (BEFORE Friday)
3. Split the black box by writer (snapshots_cloud.csv / snapshots_local.csv, grader merges)
Then: Friday week-1 review → Phase 2 the Lab (frozen vault backfill first).

## 2026-07-21 — THE THREE REPAIRS (architect critique items 1-3) — ALL GATES PASSED

**Repair 1 — security hygiene (committed 08a64ef):** every error print in
data/market_data.py now passes through _redact() (the API key becomes
***REDACTED*** before it can reach any log); journal/daily_runs.log untracked
+ gitignored. History audit ran first: the key had NEVER actually landed in
this repo's commits — the door is sealed before the leak, not after. Gate:
forced request failure printed no key; live smoke test unchanged (3/3 assets).
STILL OPEN (Commander's 2 minutes): rotate the TwelveData key (the museum
repo's old logs may hold it), update .env + the GitHub Actions secret.

**Repair 2 — grader honesty (v2):** candle-identity rule (asset + timeframe +
candle-open-time = ONE claim, earliest row wins) + always-UP parrot baseline.
Gate (synthetic): 4 rows across 2 writers → 2 unique claims. Gate (live): the
weekend's "24/24 = 100%" collapsed to 69 rows → 36 unique claims → 13 graded,
and the parrot ALSO scored 100% (18/18) → verdict: "system does NOT beat the
parrot." The inflated report card is dead; this is the honest bar for Friday.

**Repair 3 — black box split by writer:** laptop now writes
snapshots_local.csv, cloud writes snapshots_cloud.csv (writer identity =
GITHUB_ACTIONS env var); legacy snapshots.csv frozen as evidence; grader v2
merges all three notebooks at reading time. The recurring merge-conflict
disease is structurally cured (no two writers share a file). Bats + workflow +
CHECK_STATUS.bat updated to the new filenames. Gate: live local snapshot wrote
3 rows to snapshots_local.csv; cloud-identity check picks snapshots_cloud.csv.

**Next:** Commander rotates the key → Friday week-1 review (2026-07-26, on
honest numbers) → Phase 2 the Lab, starting with the frozen vault backfill.

## 2026-07-26 — WEEK-1 REVIEW (the 7-day observation verdict)

**Machinery grade: A.** Seven days, two watchmen (laptop + cloud), 189 evidence
rows, zero data losses. Every incident of the week (quoted-path scheduler bug,
battery block, LF bat endings, two-writers conflicts, PyPI dropping pandas-ta)
was found, fixed, and verified by fire. Catch-up-on-wake proven repeatedly.
The ship runs itself.

**Instruments verdict (80 graded claims, full week):** system 40.0% vs
always-UP parrot 49.5% — the system did NOT beat the parrot in week 1.
Market context: a round trip (BTC $64.5k → $66.3k → $64.4k). The EMA trend
claims said UP near the top as lagging instruments must, and the falling
half of the week graded them down (SOL worst at 29%, ETH best at 52%).
MIXED honesty rose late-week (25 claims) as the instruments caught up.

**The Commander's catch:** on Saturday ~10:00–14:00 UTC the system briefly
BEAT the parrot (42.1% vs 41.1% — preserved in cloud_grader_report.txt
history). The lead lasted hours and flipped back — recorded as the textbook
demonstration of why a 1-point lead on a small sample is noise, not skill.

**The learning (the founding lesson, now proven on our own fresh evidence):**
trend DESCRIPTION is not trend PREDICTION. The weather station describes;
it does not forecast. This is exactly why the Brief is a cockpit and not a
signal source, and why signals must earn their place through the Lab and
the sealed gauntlet. No instrument tuning done or permitted on this sample —
"fixing" lagging EMAs to match one round-trip week is the overfitting trap.

**Decisions:** observation period CLOSED. Snapshots + grading continue
forever as background heartbeat. Next: TwelveData key rotation (still on
the Commander's desk) → Phase 2 Step 2.1, the Frozen Vault, per
EXECUTION_PLAN.md.

## 2026-07-21 — EXECUTION_PLAN.md: the step-by-step orders for Phases 2-8

Commander's request: a plan so exact that any model (Opus, Sonnet) can follow
it to the point, with if/then branches for everything that can go wrong.
Written and committed as EXECUTION_PLAN.md: Phase 2 Lab in 5 gated steps
(Frozen Vault → Data Validator → honest engine with the three-dummies gate
including a planted look-ahead cheat → lie detectors → end-to-end exit gate),
then Context Deck / Carry Monitor / Trade Logger & Mirror / sealed Gauntlet
(gates locked in writing BEFORE any test) / Proving Voyage / Permanent Loop.
Includes the standing IF/THEN table (gates outrank models; too-good results =
hunt the leak first; THE PROMISE wins every argument) and a CURRENT POSITION
MARKER line each session must update. ROADMAP.md now points to it.

## 2026-07-26 — PHASE 2, STEP 2.1: THE FROZEN VAULT — GATE 2.1 PASSED

**What was built (nothing outside lab/):**
- `lab/build_vault.py` — one-time deep download through data/market_data.py
  `get_history()`. All six downloads happen in memory FIRST; not one byte is
  written unless all six arrived (the vault is only born complete). Refuses to
  run at all if a MANIFEST already exists — a born vault is never re-born
  (Law 5, evidence is never rewritten).
- `lab/vault/` — 6 CSVs, 22,986 candles total, plus MANIFEST.json (rows,
  first/last candle, days covered, byte size, SHA-256 per file, build date,
  the git commit it was built from).
- `lab/verify_vault.py` — recomputes every checksum, prints VAULT INTACT /
  VAULT CORRUPTED / VAULT MISSING per file, and names any stranger file
  sitting in the vault that the manifest does not know about. Read-only,
  clock-free output by design.
- `lab/vault/.gitattributes` (`* -text`) — the laptop runs
  core.autocrlf=true; without this, git would rewrite line endings on
  checkout and every checksum would "fail" for a reason that has nothing to
  do with the data. The vault's bytes are now frozen on every machine.

**Depth actually granted (recorded, as the plan orders): the full ask.**
TwelveData gave 3 years on all six — 4h: 6,568 candles per asset
(2023-07-27 → 2026-07-26); 1d: 1,094 per asset (2023-07-28 → 2026-07-25).
Well above the 1-year floor, above the ~4,000-row 4h expectation. No thin-data
decision needed from the Commander.

**GATE 2.1 — all three conditions, run before the commit:**
(a) all 6 files exist with plausible counts (4h 6,568 ≥ ~4,000) ✅
(b) verify_vault.py printed INTACT for all six, exit code 0 ✅
(c) run twice → byte-identical output (diff clean) ✅
Extra proof, no file touched: one price digit changed in memory
(29292.0 → 29292.1) moves the fingerprint from 9d0cd7d5... to cf96cad2... —
the guard can actually tell, it is not just printing a nice word.

**Two honest notes, neither hidden:**
1. NO VOLUME COLUMN. TwelveData returns none for BTC/ETH/SOL-USD, so the
   vault is OHLC only. Every future tool that wants volume must be told this
   before it is designed, not after.
2. The still-forming last candle was dropped from each file (its high/low/
   close are not final). A frozen vault holds only finished candles;
   recorded in MANIFEST as `unclosed_last_candle_dropped: true`.

**Next:** Step 2.2 — the Data Validator (gaps, duplicates, impossible prices,
absurd single-candle moves), with its two-part gate: clean vault file → PASS,
a deliberately corrupted COPY → must name all three diseases.

## 2026-07-26 — PHASE 2, STEP 2.2: THE DATA VALIDATOR — GATE 2.2 PASSED
## …and the inspector immediately caught the vault it was built to guard

**What was built (nothing outside lab/):**
- `lab/validator.py` — the quality inspector at the door. Takes any candle
  DataFrame and reports in plain words: missing candles (holes vs the
  timeframe's own grid), off-grid candle times, duplicate timestamps,
  blank/zero/negative prices, high-below-low, impossible candle shapes
  (high not the highest, low not the lowest), impossible intra-candle moves,
  and big-but-real swings. Verdict: PASS / WARN / FAIL. It reads only — it
  never cleans, never deletes, never decides.
- `lab/gate_2_2.py` — the exam, re-runnable by anyone forever.
- `lab/build_vault.py` — wired: every downloaded file must pass the inspector
  BEFORE a single byte is written. A vault is frozen forever, so it may not be
  born sick. Future manifests carry `validated_at_birth: true`; the current
  MANIFEST does NOT have that key, which is the honest record that it predates
  the inspector.

**GATE 2.2 — passed on the first run, before the commit:**
(a) clean vault file (BTC-USD_1d.csv) → PASS ✅
(b) a COPY of it poisoned in memory — 5 candles dropped, 2 duplicated, one
    negative price — → all three diseases named BY NAME, verdict FAIL ✅
    Plus a fourth check the plan did not ask for: the gate re-reads the real
    vault file afterwards and proves it was never touched (the poison lived
    only in memory). ✅

**ONE HONEST DEPARTURE FROM THE LETTER OF THE PLAN (Commander told, not
hidden):** the plan lists ">25% single-candle move — flag, don't delete",
which is WARN behaviour. Real crypto does 28-33% days, so >25% alone cannot
mean FAIL or the inspector cries wolf at the truth. But a candle that moves
1,000,000% is not volatility, it is a broken number. So the check has two
tiers: >25% = WARN (flagged, kept, exactly as the plan orders) and >100%
inside one candle = FAIL ("impossible price"), which belongs to the same
family as the plan's "zero/negative prices" — data that contradicts reality.
Threshold is a named constant, changeable in one line.

**THE FINDING — THE VAULT IS PARTLY DISEASED (Step 2.3 is blocked):**
Run against the frozen vault, the inspector's verdicts were:
    PASS  BTC-USD_1d.csv     — clean
    WARN  ETH-USD_1d.csv     — 2 real volatile days (28.4%, 26.6%)
    WARN  SOL-USD_1d.csv     — 9 real volatile days + 1 big jump
    FAIL  BTC-USD_4h.csv     — 42 impossible candles
    FAIL  ETH-USD_4h.csv     — 2 impossible candles
    FAIL  SOL-USD_4h.csv     — 4 impossible candles
48 candles arrived from TwelveData with a decimal point in the wrong place —
the `low` divided by ~10,000. Examples: BTC 2023-07-28 12:00 shows a low of
$2.93 inside a $29,206 candle; SOL 2023-12-12 16:00 shows a low of
$0.00000224 inside a $68 candle. TWO BTC candles have a broken CLOSE as well
(2023-08-01 12:00 closes at $2.8954). All 48 sit in 2023-07 → 2023-12; the
1d files of the same period are clean, so the glitch is in the source's 4h
series, not in our download code.

**Why this matters more than it looks:** a backtest cannot tell a broken
candle from a real crash. Any stop-loss placed above $2.93 would have been
"hit" 42 times in BTC alone — the engine would report losses that never
happened, or "buy the dip" at prices that never existed. This is precisely
the "garbage in = lies out" that Step 2.2 exists to prevent. The inspector
justified its existence within an hour of being born, against our own data.

**Nothing was repaired, cleaned or deleted.** The vault is evidence and it
still verifies INTACT (checksums unchanged, verify_vault.py re-run after all
of today's changes). The decision — re-download the three 4h files with the
inspector standing at the door, or run Phase 2 on daily candles only — is the
Commander's, and it is recorded here as an open blocker on Step 2.3.

**Next:** the Commander's decision on the diseased 4h files, THEN Step 2.3
(the honest backtest engine with the three-dummies gate).

## 2026-07-26 — VAULT RE-BIRTH ATTEMPTED — REFUSED BY THE DOOR (blocker stands)

**The Commander's written order:** delete lab/vault/ and rebuild it through the
now-guarded builder; legal ONCE because the diseased original is committed and
pushed (aa6de2d, e63a9ca) — git history keeps the evidence, so Law 5 is
satisfied, not violated.

**Executed in the ordered sequence:**
1. `git pull` — fast-forwarded to 8a17fe3 (cloud snapshots).
2. `verify_vault.py` BEFORE touching anything → INTACT for all six. We only
   re-birth from a known state.
3. Proof of reversibility taken first: the committed blob of BTC-USD_4h.csv in
   aa6de2d hashes to 9d0cd7d5…, byte-identical to the file on disk. The old
   vault is genuinely recoverable, not "probably" recoverable.
4. lab/vault/ deleted (plus an off-repo scratch copy as belt-and-braces).
5. `build_vault.py` run.

**THE DOOR REFUSED AT FILE 1 OF 6.** BTC-USD 4h came back from TwelveData with
the SAME 42 impossible candles. The builder printed the inspector's report,
wrote nothing, and exited 1 — exactly the behaviour Step 2.2 was built to
produce. Nothing was ever written to disk.

**Then the vault was restored to its committed state** (`git checkout -- lab/vault`)
and re-verified: INTACT for all six, and `git status lab/` shows zero changes.
The failed re-birth left no scar. The repo is exactly as it was.

**RECONNAISSANCE (read-only, run from the scratchpad — nothing added to lab/):**
all three 4h series were downloaded fresh and compared, candle by candle,
against the vault's copies. The result is the decisive fact:

    BTC-USD 4h : 42 diseased fresh, 42 in vault — SAME candles: TRUE
    ETH-USD 4h :  2 diseased fresh,  2 in vault — SAME candles: TRUE
    SOL-USD 4h :  4 diseased fresh,  4 in vault — SAME candles: TRUE

**THE GLITCH IS PERMANENT IN TWELVEDATA'S STORED HISTORY.** It is not a
transient download error. Re-downloading will never fix it, today or in a year.
That option is now closed by evidence, not by opinion.

**Exactly which candles came back diseased (all 48):**

**Two facts that shape the decision (stated, not acted on):**
1. 47 of the 48 have ONLY the `low` broken — open, high and close are sane.
   The single exception is BTC 2023-08-01 12:00, whose CLOSE is also broken
   ($2.8954 instead of ~$28,954).
2. Every diseased candle sits between 2023-07-28 and 2023-12-20 — the first
   five months of the three-year window. The last one in each asset:
   BTC 2023-09-14, ETH 2023-12-19, SOL 2023-12-20. From 2023-12-21 onward all
   three 4h series are free of impossible candles, and the 1d files covering
   the diseased period are clean throughout.

**RECORD CORRECTION (we correct forward, we do not rewrite the past):** the
Step 2.2 entry above says TWO BTC candles have a broken close. The true count
is ONE — 2023-08-01 12:00, close $2.8954. One broken close produces TWO
candle-to-candle jumps (into it and out of it), which is what caused the
miscount. The Step 2.2 entry stands as written; this line is the correction.

**Nothing was repaired, no candle was hand-edited, no low was multiplied by
10,000, no second data source was touched, and the validator's standards were
not lowered.** All four were explicitly forbidden by the order, and all four
remain undone.

**Step 2.3 stays BLOCKED.** The re-download option is dead on evidence. The
decision — and it belongs to the Commander, not to a session — is now between
the honest remaining routes: run the Lab on 1d only; start the 4h window at
2024-01-01 and record the shortened depth; or bring in a second data source
with the Commander's explicit yes. No session may choose this alone.
